# Ethereum Facts

I am a newbie to the cryptocurrency space and at the time of this writing, it has been less than a month. Prior to all these, all I know is what I can randomly
came across in youtube. I am drafting this document as a means to led you straigth into the belly of Ethereum and ignore the rest of the massive speculative
literatures written about it. This document is for Ethereum only and as soon as you get familiarized with it, it should pave a guided path to explore the rest
of the competing alternatives such as [Solana](https://solana.com/), [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) etc. From what 
I observed, the cryptocurrency space is littered with lesser-skilled software engineers more than the really skilled ones. Added into the mix are the speculative
mumbo-jumbo of certain personalities with intention of steering the mass perception of the space. 

### The Merge

It is a technical improvement of the Ethereum network that aims to solve the problems of electricity usage, scalability and many other things. There are two
major forces that is working on this and as you shall begin to understand, these has to do with the piece of *client software* and the organizations that backed these, that is responsible for the 
Ethereum network:

- [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)
- [openethereum](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum)

There is no central location where one can say, *look, it is here*. The Ethereum blockchain is the series of blocks that were created and linked together and
these piece of data exists in several local computers that is running the *client software*. The software engineers that improves these *client software* are
paid by the orginizations that owned these *client software*. 

The [Youtube Ethereum Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumFoundation) videos should tell you the straight facts of the technical progress of **The Merge**.

### Ethereum Roadmap

Try to follow through the discussions of the [EIP-1559](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1559-fee-market-change-for-eth-1-0-chain/2783/24) and this [EIP-1559 Youtube Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaT-BIzWSew&t=4708s) 
during the technical deliberation of this particular Ethereum improvement proposal. 

The list of proposals are [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/all).
