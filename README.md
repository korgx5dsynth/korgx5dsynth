# Korg X5D

I am not a musician nor even having the talent for it. I like this particular instrument because it is small and it packs interesting configurability that allows you to control the shape of a sound. The Korg X5D is more of a sound machine than a musical instrument. Several owners of this instrument have not really fully exploited its full potential and only lately [Jayb's exploration](https://youtu.be/w1jvPARJ0ck) have shown that the [AI2 Synthesis](cdn.korg.com/us/support/download/files/e9e67c8c8e643bbfdd7300867f2f1a58.pdf) used in the X5D is a formidable piece of technology even by today's standards. In fact, the amount of sounds that X5D can produce is infinite. It has taken me 20 years to notice its profound complexity. I bought my X5D in 2003 and it was never used because I didn't understand it. The COVID lockdown gave me an opportunity to read its manual while my phone was ringing from a buyer as I was about to sell it. As soon as I googled what an [ADSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)) was, I knew that I have entered into a domain filled with concepts that I never thought exists. That sound has a shape and the Korg X5D posseses the technology to shape a sound [according to your will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_City_(1998_film)). I can immerse myself into a different exploration as a temporary and refreshing escape.
